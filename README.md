# Super Simple Serial Terminal
A 4-line Character LCD serial terminal for interfacing with a desktop PC.

This is the code for the project I wrote in 2008 for Hackaday.com. The original website I posted the code on no longer exists, so I snagged the code from archive.org.  Nowadays, you'll likely use a USB Serial converter (like FTDI or P2101). Check out the tutorial article here: https://hackaday.com/2008/05/29/how-to-super-simple-serial-terminal/
