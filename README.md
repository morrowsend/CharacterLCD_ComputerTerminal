# Super Simple Serial Terminal
A 4-line Character LCD serial terminal for interfacing with a desktop PC. This connectec an old PS/2 keyboard to the chip controlling the LCD screen, and communicated via serial to the PC to send and receive characters.  

This is the code for the project I wrote in 2008 for Hackaday.com. The original website I posted the code on no longer exists, so I snagged the code from archive.org.  Nowadays, you'll likely use a USB Serial converter (like FTDI or CP2101) instead of a MAX233 and a USBhost instead of PS/2 connector for the keyboard.
